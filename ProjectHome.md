# CityBus #

An application that is currently being built by Purdue's ACM SigApp group which will provide a convenient way for students on Purdue's campus to view bus route information.

Currently supports:
  * Google Maps view with overlayed bus stops and bus routes
  * Tap on bus stop bring up a dialog to show next coming buses
  * Augmented reality to help navigate towards bus stops

Future implementations:
  * Time table view for bus stops
  * The rest of CityBus's routes
  * Real time location of buses
  * Real time location of user
  * Location to Location directions for users
